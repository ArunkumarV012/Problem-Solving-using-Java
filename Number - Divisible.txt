Write a program to check the given number is divisible by 7 and 11 or only by 7 or only by 11 or not.


import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scn = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = scn.nextInt();
        if (a%7==0 && a%11==0) {
            System.out.println(a +" is divisible by both the numbers");
        }
        else if(a%7==0 && a%11!=0) {
            System.out.println(a +" is divisible by only 7");
        }
        else if(a%11==0 && a%7!=0){
            System.out.println(a +" is divisible by only 11");
        }
        else{
            System.out.println(a +" is not divisible by both 7 and 11");
